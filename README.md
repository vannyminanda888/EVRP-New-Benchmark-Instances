These benchmark instances are designed for the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP). 
Their solvability has been tested using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model in the Gurobi solver. The customers represent 178 hospitals across northern Taiwan, with demand defined based on hospital data. This benchmark is specifically tailored for solving medical waste collection between hospitals in Taiwan.
